# React eShop

Access here: https://my-react-eshop.herokuapp.com/

This is an eshop I made, within the intention of learning react-router-dom v6, Firebase v9 and useContext and useReducer hooks. (might take you an hour to make, but took me 4 days to learn, thanks to so many tutorials).

## Tools used

### React

- useContext and useReduser
- React-router-dom v6

### Firebase

- Firebase v9

### Material-UI

- MUI v5.5.1

## Functions

Register and log in/out.
Add items or delete at the shopping cart, and calculate total.

## Functions yet to be done

Number of items
Login using gmail etc

...well, I might go and learn sth. else instead, so many things out there to learn.
